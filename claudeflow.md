Looking at your yield farming aggregator flowchart, I'll break down the smart contract logic and architecture you'll need to build this system.

## Core Smart Contract Architecture

Your yield farming aggregator will need several interconnected smart contracts:

### 1. **Main Aggregator Contract**
This is your central hub that orchestrates everything:

```solidity
contract YieldAggregator {
    // User positions tracking
    mapping(address => UserPosition[]) public userPositions;
    
    // Protocol adapters
    mapping(string => address) public protocolAdapters;
    
    // Auto-compound settings
    mapping(address => AutoCompoundSettings) public userSettings;
}
```

### 2. **Protocol Adapter Contracts**
One for each DeFi protocol (Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc.):

```solidity
interface IProtocolAdapter {
    function deposit(uint256 amount, address token) external returns (uint256);
    function withdraw(uint256 amount, address token) external returns (uint256);
    function getCurrentAPY(address token) external view returns (uint256);
    function getRewards(address user) external view returns (uint256);
    function claimRewards() external returns (uint256);
}
```

### 3. **Strategy Manager Contract**
Handles the logic for comparing yields and switching strategies:

```solidity
contract StrategyManager {
    function findBestYield(address token, uint256 amount) 
        external view returns (string memory protocol, uint256 apy);
    
    function calculateSwitchBenefit(
        address user, 
        uint256 positionIndex, 
        string memory newProtocol
    ) external view returns (int256 netBenefit);
}
```

## Key Smart Contract Logic Flow

### **Investment Flow:**
1. User calls `invest(token, amount, preferredProtocol)`
2. Contract validates amount against user balance
3. Strategy Manager finds best yield if no preference
4. Transfers tokens from user to aggregator
5. Calls appropriate Protocol Adapter to deposit
6. Updates user position tracking
7. Emits investment event

### **Auto-Compound Logic:**
1. Keeper/bot calls `autoCompound(user, positionIndex)`
2. Check accrued rewards via Protocol Adapter
3. Calculate gas costs vs rewards
4. If profitable: claim rewards → reinvest → update position
5. Emit compound event

### **Strategy Switching Logic:**
1. Monitor calls `checkStrategySwitch(user, positionIndex)`
2. Get current APY from existing protocol
3. Query all other protocols for better rates
4. Calculate net benefit (new APY - current APY - gas costs)
5. If beneficial and user has auto-switch enabled:
   - Withdraw from current protocol
   - Deposit to new protocol
   - Update position data

## Building Strategy - Step by Step

### **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
1. **Start with the main aggregator contract**
   - User position tracking
   - Basic deposit/withdraw functions
   - Access control and security measures

2. **Build one protocol adapter first** (I recommend Compound - it's simpler)
   - Implement deposit/withdraw
   - APY calculation functions
   - Reward claiming logic

3. **Create basic position management**
   - Track user investments
   - Calculate current values
   - Handle withdrawals

### **Phase 2: Strategy Engine**
1. **Build the Strategy Manager**
   - Yield comparison logic
   - Gas cost estimation
   - Risk scoring (optional for MVP)

2. **Implement auto-compound**
   - Threshold checking
   - Profitability calculations
   - Automated reinvestment

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. **Add more protocol adapters**
   - Aave, Uniswap V3, etc.
   - Standardize the interface

2. **Strategy switching**
   - Migration logic between protocols
   - User preference handling
   - Slippage protection

3. **Risk management**
   - Protocol health monitoring
   - Emergency withdrawal mechanisms
   - Portfolio limits

## Critical Smart Contract Considerations

### **Security Measures:**
- Use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
- Implement proper access controls
- Add pause functionality for emergencies
- Validate all external protocol interactions

### **Gas Optimization:**
- Batch operations where possible
- Use events for off-chain monitoring
- Minimize storage writes
- Consider proxy patterns for upgradability

### **Error Handling:**
- Graceful failures when protocols are down
- Revert with meaningful error messages
- Circuit breakers for protocol issues

### **Data Management:**
- Store minimal data on-chain
- Use events for historical tracking
- Consider using oracles for APY data

## Recommended Tech Stack

**Smart Contracts:**
- Solidity ^0.8.19
- Hardhat for development
- OpenZeppelin for security primitives

**Testing:**
- Hardhat tests
- Fork mainnet for protocol integration testing
- Foundry for advanced testing (optional)

**Deployment:**
- Start on testnets (Goerli/Sepolia)
- Use Create2 for deterministic addresses
- Multi-sig for contract ownership

Start with a simple MVP that can deposit to one protocol and track positions. Then gradually add the auto-compound logic, strategy switching, and additional protocols. This approach lets you test each component thoroughly before adding complexity.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this architecture or provide more detailed code examples for particular components?
